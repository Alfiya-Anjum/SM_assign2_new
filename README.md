The code provided automates the collection of web performance metrics from Wikipedia's "Software metric" page using Puppeteer and Node.js. It navigates to the URL multiple times(10 times), gathers performance entries, calculates average metrics, and saves the data in both JSON and CSV formats for easy analysis and sharing. The CSV file organizes the data with "name" and "duration" columns, facilitating further analysis in spreadsheet software. This script exemplifies the use of Puppeteer for web scraping and performance monitoring, demonstrating a practical application of headless browser automation for data collection and analysis.
